title: One-click deploy
description: Deployment methods for Plane have improved significantly to make self-managing super-easy. One of those is a single-line-command installation of Plane. This short guide will guide you through the process, the background tasks that run with the command for the Community, One, and Enterprise editions, and the post-deployment configuration options available to you.

### Manage your Plane instance

Use `plane-app` [OPERATOR] to manage your Plane instance easily. Get a list of all operators with `plane-app ---help`.

1. Basic operators

   1. `plane-app start` starts the Plane server.
   2. `plane-app restart` restarts the Plane server.
   3. `plane-app stop` stops the Plane server.

2. Advanced operators

   `plane-app --configure` will show advanced configurators.
