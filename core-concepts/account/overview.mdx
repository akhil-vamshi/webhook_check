## Workspace home

Once logged in and within a workspace, the home page reflects your involvement in issues - those assigned to you, created by you, and completed by you. You can readily identify both due and overdue issues. Additionally, you have the option to view issues assigned to you categorized by their state and priority. Your recent activities, projects, and collaborators are also easily accessible on the home page.
