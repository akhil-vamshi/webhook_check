title: Inbox
---

Inbox is a Plane-only feature that lets project members (`guests` and `viewers`) create issues and project admins (`admin` and `members`) add issues inside a project. Inbox can take bug reports, feature or service requests, or raise a ticket by stakeholders, customers, or clients. Issues created in the inbox can then be accepted to move them to the Projectâ€™s workflow. Inbox functions at the project level and is toggled off by default. It can be enabled from the `Features` tab under project settings.

## Properties in an Inbox issue

For an issue in the inbox, you can choose to assign the following properties,

1. State - If the issue in the inbox is still being triaged, you can assign it to the proper state to help you identify the progress before moving it to your project.
2. Assignees - If the issue needs to be triaged or prioritized by a specific member in your team, you can simply assign it to them
3. Priority - Helps you or the issue creator set the priority of the issue to align the expectations on how quickly the issue should be acted upon.
4. Due dates - You can also track when the issue needs to be prioritized or triaged by adding due dates.
5. Labels - Helps you categorize issues using the same labels available in the project; you can also create a new label from here to categorize issues.  

A `guest` or `viewer` can assign this properties at the time of creating an inbox issue. However, these properties can be overridden by project `admin` or `member` later.

## Action for an Inbox issue

When a project member creates an issue, it is added to the â€˜Pendingâ€™ state. An Inbox issue can then be accepted, declined, snoozed for a later time, or marked as duplicate.

- Accepting an Issue
    
    You can accept a â€˜pendingâ€™ issue, after which the state changes to â€˜backlogâ€™ (or the default state set for that project.) This can be done by clicking on the â€˜acceptâ€™ button present on any pending issue. This will open a modal where you can change the issue details before moving it to your project.

- Declining an Issue
    
    If the issue is not relevant to your project, you can chose to decline it. An issue can be declined by clicking on â€˜declineâ€™ button present on any pending issue. Once the issue is declined, it ends up in the cancelled state of your project.

## Open and closed issues

You can view Open or closed issues on the Inbox sidebar.

â€˜Pendingâ€™ or â€˜Snoozedâ€™ issues are considered Open issues. Further action can take place on such issues. Whereas â€˜Accepted,â€™ â€˜Declined,â€™ and â€˜Duplicateâ€™ are closed issues. No further action is required on closed issues.

## Sorting and Filtering

Like issues, sorting and filtering can create a focused view in an Inbox. Filters and sorting can be applied to the list of issues simultaneously. 

**Filtering inbox issues**

Filters can be assigned from the filters dropdown available on the left-hand side of the Inbox page. Inbox issues can be filtered by issue status, state, priority, assignee, created by, labels, created date, and last updated date.

**Sorting inbox issues**

Next to filters, you can use the sort drop-down to arrange issues sequentially. Issues can be sorted by date created, date updated, and issue ID in ascending or descending order.
